### Open-source Stuff

* [Too many repos on GitHub](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/), including work stuff (like [DateTime helpers for computing market holidays](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/MarketHolidays)), and fun stuff (like [RPG Maker plugins](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/RPG-Maker-MV-Plugins), and [a windows tool that lets you quickly copy-paste complicated emoticons ヾ（＾ヮ＾)ﾉ](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/DesktopEmoticons)).
