## Games

### PoppySeedPets - [poppyseedpets.com](https://poppyseedpets.com)

A pet game played in your browser. I started it during the summer of 2019, releasing the first "version" after 2-3 weeks of work. I'm continuing to work on it today, and sometimes live-stream coding bugfixes and new features.

* **For-funsies details:** Free-to-play, no ads, no microtransactions, no collecting or selling of your data... feel free to [support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/BenMakesGames) ;P
* **Technical details:** Angular front-end, PHP/Symfony REST & RPC API; hosted on AWS using S3, CloudFront, EC2, ELB (load-balancer), RDS (Aurora/MySQL DB), Redis, SES (email), and probably other things. I use InkScape for most of the graphics, which I mostly made myself!

### Word x Word - [available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2225460/Word_x_Word/)

A retro word-puzzle game show game, heavily-inspired by the DOS game [Lexi-Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi-Cross) which I played far too much of as a kid :P

**For-funsies details:** A 1v1 game - share your keyboard and/or mouse to play with a local friend, or play against an AI with two difficulty settings. Customize your contestants, and earn a place on the Hall of Fame! Over 300 puzzles, with thousands of variations!
**Technical details:** C#/MonoGame, .NET 6; I wrote & made all the music myself in [Bosca Ceoli](https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/bosca-ceoil), which may have been a mistake; you can judge :P My first commercial release built using my open-source framework, [PlayPlayMini](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BenMakesGames.PlayPlayMini/).

### Mysterious Space - [available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368700/Mysterious_Space/)

A retro, action Rogue-lite on Steam... (because Steam doesn't have enough of those, already...)

**For-funsies details:** Featuring original music by [DDRKirby(ISQ)](https://ddrkirbyisq.bandcamp.com/). Explore a procedurally-generated sector of space to discover the mysterious signal emenating from its center...
**Technical details:** C#/MonoGame, .NET 4; Steam API integration for Steam achievements. Worked with French, German, and Turkish speakers to translate the game into those languages, and did partial translations in several other languages.

### Misc - [on itch.io](https://benmakesgames.itch.io/)

A few old RPGs and action games I made, and are available for free, a couple incomplete games, and a couple resource packs.

**For-funsies details:** I particularly recommend [Dreams About Squash](https://benmakesgames.itch.io/dreams-about-squash), and [On the Edge of Candy Space: A Memory](https://benmakesgames.itch.io/at-the-edge-of-candy-space-a-memory), which are both short RPGs made for game jams, and are both totally free!
**Technical details:** A mix of C++/SDL, C#/MonoGame, and JavaScript/RPGMaker. I use InkScape and Fireworks for many of the graphics (even though Adobe abandoned Fireworks forever ago...)

## Open-source Stuff

* [Over a dozen NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/BenMakesGames), mostly game-focused, but there are a couple general utility packages. All are .NET 5+, because .NET 4 needs to go away now, plz :P
* [Too many repos on GitHub](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/), including work stuff (like [DateTime helpers for computing market holidays](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/MarketHolidays)), and fun stuff (like [RPG Maker plugins](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/RPG-Maker-MV-Plugins), and [a windows tool that lets you quickly copy-paste complicated emoticons ヾ（＾ヮ＾)ﾉ](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/DesktopEmoticons)).
